Project Overview
This project is done as the practical assignment of module ITE2152-Mobile Application Development of Bachelor of Information Technology degree conducted by the University of Moratuwa.
Following objectives are to be met within a timeframe of 24hours.

Assignment: Weather Application
Objective: Create a simple weather application that displays current weather information for your current location.
Requirements:
    Main Features
        User Interface (UI) Screen One:
            Create a main screen with three text views to display the following
                Current Latitude and Longitude of your location using decimal degrees format.
                Reverse geo-coded address of your location
                Current System Time
            Display weather information including temperature, humidity, and weather description in a TextView or a CardView.
        Networking
            Use an appropriate library to fetch weather data from an open weather API (e.g., OpenWeatherMap).
            Handle network operations asynchronously.
        Data Parsing:
            Parse the JSON response from the API to extract required weather information.
    Testing:
        Test the app on an emulator or physical device.
    Deliverables:
        The complete Android project source code in a GitHub repository.
        A README file explaining the project, including setup instructions and any additional features implemented.
        Screenshots or a short video demo of the app in action.
